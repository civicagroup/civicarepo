## Overview
### Description
Civica is an app that promotes civic engagement by providing the user access to information about their representatives in one centralized hub. With Civica users input their address in order to receive a list of all their representatives from the presidential to the municipal level and everything in between. When users tap on the name of a representative they have access to the latest news about them as well as a look into their latest tweets.
