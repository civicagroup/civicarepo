## Overview
### Description
Civica is an app that promotes civic engagement by providing the user access to information about their representatives in one centralized hub. With Civica users input their address in order to receive a list of all their representatives from the presidential to the municipal level and everything in between. When users tap on the name of a representative they have access to the latest news about them as well as a look into their latest tweets. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Civic Engagement
- **Mobile:** App would be mobile first (iOS), but could be expanded to desktop.
- **Story:** Connects citizens with their local representatives, raise awareness of community development, invite users to be participants of local volunteering events. An app that the folks at Pawness in Parks & Rec would use.
- **Market:** There is a market gap in apps for civic engagement. Average citizens who would like to be more informed or engaged with their local governments and civic organizations would find this app userful. 
- **Habit:** By offering pertinent news stories and personal tweets, this app provides users a personal touch of civic engagement that government websites cannot rival.
- **Scope:** First this app serves as an information aggregator. Gradually, we would like to see community leaders use this app to communicate civic events with the users.
